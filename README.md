# Estimating vaccine coverage in conflict settings using geospatial methods: a case study in Borno state, Nigeria

This repo contains cleaned code used to:

1. Generate estimates of routine first- and third-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing-vaccine (DTP1 and DTP3) coverage.
2. Assess vaccination coverage estimates and conflict data across Nigeria, particularly in Borno state.

This code was used in producing the analyses described in the following citation:
Sbarra AN, Rolfe S, Haeuser E, et al. Estimating vaccine coverage in conflict settings using geospatial methods: a case study in Borno state, Nigeria. Scientific Reports 2023. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37947-8.

This repo contains three directories:
- lbd_core contains general code for model based geostatistics methods.
- vaccine contains code that is specific to estimating vaccination coverage
- vaccines contains additional wrapper and data processing scripts, along with additional supporting data.
